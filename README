ML Project Pipeline
--------------------
Data Collection --> Data Cleaning --> ML Model Training --> algos for application of the models --> Deployment


Timeline
--------

1. Data Collection       |
2. Data Cleaning         |  ==> (1-2) Months , Time taking process and no gaurantee of success
3. ML Model Training     |

4. Algo for application  |
5. Implementing          |  ==> (1-2) Months
6. Deployment            |


This makes the total time 4 months .. and we don't have that much time

Solution
---------
1. Data Collection       |
2. Data Cleaning         |  ==> Solution : Download Pretrained weights for the model (saves time of training and we get a good accuracy)
3. ML Model Training     |

4. Algo for application  |
5. Implementing          |  ==> Solution : To make the project impressive we need to work more on the application side
6. Deployment            |

Conclusion:
- Pick a project which is basically an impressive application of common AI Problems (cause then only we will get good pretrained weights)


Ideas
-----

Computer Vision:

- Face Detection
	- A Hardware camera made (using servo's) for tracking your face basically for work from home situation
- Facial Landmark Detection:
	- Snapchat filter type application (more practical applications : clone of lenskart.com  or any products like earphone also possible)
		- Adavantage of choosing this : There is no upper limit to improvements .. but we can pivot at any point of time
- Body Pose Detection:
	- White Board Marker Using Your hands (open cv + hand pose detection)
	- Yoga Mate (algo's + body pose detection)


NLP:
- Text Summarization:
	- An app to summarize your newspaper articles to save you time
- Music Generation
	- No strong application .. mostly research based

RL:
- AI Game Player type stufff .. also mostly research based
